From terminal access: 
	This directory is representative of a GitHub project, and can be located
	there at https://github.com/cryptmaster/shiny-barnacle.


Notes on files:	
	Scripts have been modified to read JSON of YELP review files out of saved
	apfannenstein/projects directory, allowing use off-grid.
	To remedy this: use vplyzinski/projects directory later on.

	Python scripts were written using Python 2. Many scripts are based off those
	originally developed by gsell.
